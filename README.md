# Player Management System (C++ using Templates and File Handling)
The **Player Management System** is a C++ project that allows users to manage player records efficiently using a **Doubly Linked List** implemented with **templates**.
It also includes **file handling** for saving and loading player data, ensuring data persistence between program runs.

## Features:
✅ Add, delete, Search, Sort and display player records  
✅ Uses templates for generic, reusable linked list implementation  
✅ File handling to save player data to a binary file for faster read/write  
✅ Efficient insertion and traversal using a Doubly Linked List  
✅ Modular and well-structured code (Header and Source separation)

## Technologies Used: <br>
   **Language**: C++  
   **Data Structure:** Doubly Linked List(Dynamic Memory Allocation)
   **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Encapsulation)
